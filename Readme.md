# LeetCode Solutions Portfolio

Welcome to my LeetCode Solutions Portfolio! This repository showcases my problem-solving skills by presenting solutions to various problems from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/). Each solution is crafted with care, considering both efficiency and readability, and can serve as a reference or starting point for fellow learners.

## üåü Features

- Modular code structure for easy navigation.
- Comprehensive explanations and analyses for each solution.
- Testability: Solutions can be executed and tested individually.
- An interactive menu system for executing specific problems.

## üìÅ Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `Problems`: Contains subfolders for each problem category (e.g., `Easy`, `Medium`, `Hard`), within which individual problem solutions are located.
- `MenuItems`: Contains a dictionary mapping of problem identifiers to their respective problem solutions, allowing for easy navigation and execution.
- `Program.cs`: The main entry point for the application, which interacts with the `MenuItems` to provide a seamless user experience.
